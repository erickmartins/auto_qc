Title: Automatic PSF quality measurement

Input file: a file of the specified file format (file extension) containing the string "psf"

Dimension: at least 300x300

Content: PSFs from flourescent beads
         The usual PSF measurement criteria apply:
         Well separated beads, not too dense, subresolution.

Output: summary table with quality measurements per bead
        Will be written into the base input directory

Input parameters 

- Input directory - GUI interaction that points to the directory where input data is

- File extension: self-explanatory

- Number of beads: how many beads should be analysed

- Correction factors: multiplying factor for the FWHM resolution output from MetroloJ, per dimension

- minSeparation: minimal distance (in pixels) that two PSFs need to be separated by to be considered

Description:

Finds the relevant stack within the specified diretory that contains the bead measurement.
Opens the stack using bioformats importer.
Crops the stack to get the center of the field of view.
Gets the slice that is in focus (max standard deviation).
Detects the beads via maximum detection.
Takes the location of the point detection.
Extracts the intensity of the pixel at that point.
Selects the specified number of beads with the lowest intensity that are well separated.
Crops out these selected beads from the stack.
Applies PSFprofiler of the MetroloJ plugin to get resolution of microscope.

Functions of the plugin:

run:
Opens dialog for choosing a file.
Gets based path of file.

readFile:
Opens file using Bioformats import.
Calls processing function.
Specifies result file.
Calls WriteFile to save result table.

processing:
Crops the image to get middle of the field of view.
Finds the in Focus slice via maximum standard deviation.
Detects maxima in the in Focus slice.
Gets coordinates of ROIs and gets Pixel Value at this coordinate.
Sorts the Pixel coordinates by the intensity value.
Selects beads based on specified criteria.
Crops out the PSFs
Calls GetRes function to get Resolution values.
Multiplies the resolution values with the correction factors.

WriteFile:
Writes the result files with header

GetRes:
Calls the PSF Profiler of MetroloJ on cropped PSF
